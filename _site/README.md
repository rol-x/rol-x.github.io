### What is this page, anyway?

This website has been shaped from several templates, mainly the [`github/personal-website`](https://github.com/github/personal-website) repository. Since I'm not a keen on playing with colors and divs, this was a process of trial and error. Each project is hand-picked for presentation and briefly described on a separate page. [Take a look](https://rol-x.github.io)!
