### What is this page, anyway?

This website has been moulded from a few templates, mainly [the `github/personal-website` repository](https://github.com/github/personal-website). Since I'm not a heavy HTML/CSS user, and not any other website-building-tool user to be frank, this was a process of trial and error. The pages are kept simple and minimalistic, while maximally customized at the same time, so that they can serve as my personal resume suited for the contemporary market. Each project is hand-picked for presentation and briefly described on a separate page. Go ahead and snoop around!
